		<h1>Hi, I'm kuizeo.</h1>

		<p>
			I'm supposed to have made something here by now, but I'm extremely lazy,
			so I haven't. Here's a little site I threw together in 30 seconds as a
			placeholder.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you're interested in what I do, you can click one of these two links:

			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/kuizeo">GitHub</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://discord.com/users/943677900576682024">Discord</a>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			Oh, and <a href="images/">here</a> are some images of the new version of
			the site. Early work in progress, feel free to send me feedback.
